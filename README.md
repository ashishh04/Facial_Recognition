🔐 Real-Time Facial Recognition Access Control System
This project is a complete real-time facial recognition-based access control system that integrates:

🎯 ArcFace embeddings using InsightFace for accurate face matching

👁️ Blink-based liveness detection using dlib to prevent spoofing

🧠 MySQL database logging for access attempts (granted/denied)

📊 Streamlit Dashboard to monitor and filter access logs in real time

📷 Live webcam feed, bounding boxes, identity labeling, and spoof detection
